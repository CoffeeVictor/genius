# About the project

## What is it? 😯

This is a very simple interpretation of the famous "Genius" game on the web.

## Why i did it? 🤔

This was a project assignment for Eduzz's Fullstack Developer Bootcamp on the Digital Innovation One platform. Even though i had knowlege on more advanced programming topics i figured it wouldn't hurt to get back to the basics and exercise some plain and simple JS.

## So just a copy/paste project? 😒

Not at all, in fact, it was recommended that each participant added it's own features/improvements. I chose to add a simple "New Game" button and score display and (my favorite part) a few sounds! I just couldn't imagine playing Genius in complete silence 😁
