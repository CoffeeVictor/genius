# About the project

## What is it? 😯

This is a very simple interpretation of the famous "Genius" game on the web.

## How to run it?

### You can see a live version [here](https://coffeevictor.github.io/genius/src/)

1. Clone the project
   - ``git clone git@github.com:CoffeeVictor/genius.git``
2. Open the ``src/index.html`` file with a local server (i recommend Live Server) or just open it with a browser of your choice
## Why i did it? 🤔

This was a project assignment for Eduzz's Fullstack Developer Bootcamp on the Digital Innovation One platform. Even though i had knowlege on more advanced programming topics i figured it wouldn't hurt to get back to the basics and exercise some plain and simple JS.

## So just a copy/paste project? 😒

Not at all, in fact, it was recommended that each participant added it's own features/improvements. I chose to add a simple "New Game" button and score display and (my favorite part) a few sounds! I just couldn't imagine playing Genius in complete silence 😁
